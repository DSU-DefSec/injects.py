# injects.py
Simple script to auto post injects to discord and scoring engine

## Configs:

#### injects.json:
```json
{
  "injects": [
    {
      "name": "Name of inject",
      "desc": "Description of inject",
      "post": "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss",
      "due": "2020-09-05 16:00:00"
    },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```
#### config.json:
```json
{
  "discord": "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/##################/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "discord_content": "Whatever you want in the discord message content (not the embed)",
  "engine": "http://scoring.engine/to/be/implemented/later/webhook.html",
  "close_enough": 10 // Seconds before post time that inject can be sent (if 0 then could be sent a bit late)
}
```


## Usage:
#### Standalone:
Will wait until the right time then post injects  
Updates `state.json` as it goes. Will start back up in the same spot if restarted
```
$ python3 injects.py
```

#### Single run:
Will post any injects that should be posted after the last posted `state.json` and before the current time then exit  
Could crontab this if you dont want the script always running
```
$ python3 injects.py <literally anything but a number and all>
$ python3 injects.py tacocat
```

#### Specific inject:
Will post specific inject and exit ignoring `state.json`
```
$ python3 injects.py <inject number>
$ python3 injects.py 3
```

#### All injects:
Will post all injects ignoring `state.json` (requires confirmation)
```
$ python3 injects.py all
```
